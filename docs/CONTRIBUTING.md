Contibuting to Common Garden
============================

General ways to contribute to the development of Common Garden:
* Report bugs or tell us about features you are missing by opening tickets or commenting them.
* Contribute to the Common Garden source code.
* Code review an open pull request.
* Help us test Common Garden.
* Read (and contribute to) our wiki and other documentation.
* Spread the word.

Reporting bugs
--------------

If you have found a bug in Common Garden software, file a bug report in the relevant repository's issue tracker.

Common Garden has many moving parts, and it is often difficult to reproduce a bug based on a vague description. If you want somebody to be able to fix a bug (or verify a fix that you have contributed), the best way is:
* Find minimal and exact steps needed to reproduce the bug.
* Describe what you expected to happen and what happened instead.
* Specify what version of Common Garden you are using (your own local development version, beta/stage version, public version).
* Provide as much as you can about the environment you are using (operating system, browser, are you behind any proxy, are you on campus or off campus).
* Make and attach a screenshot or screenshots relevant to the bug you are reporting. You can use [LICEcap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to create a live capture of the bug as a GIF file and attach it to the issue. Do not forget to obfuscate any possibly sensitive or private information visible there.

By making it as easy as possible for others to reproduce your bug, you make it easier for your bug to be fixed. We are not always able to tackle issues opened without a reproduction recipe. In those cases we will close them with a pointer to this wiki section and a request for more information.

Contributing code
-----------------

We are using GitHub and pull requests for development. If pull requests are new to you, see [this tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) to find out how to fork and contribute to our repository. GitHub is build around [git](http://git-scm.com/). If you are unfamiliar with git, [this tutorial will help you](https://try.github.io/). Also familiarize yourself with general [version control vocabulary](http://producingoss.com/en/producingoss.html#vc-vocabulary).

Before submitting a pull request, make sure that it follows these guidelines:
* Make sure that your branch is based off of the `master` branch. The `master` branch is where active development happens currently.
* Limit yourself to one feature or bug fix per pull request.
* Name your branch to match the feature/bug fix that you are submitting.
* Write clear, descriptive commit messages.
* Describe your pull request in as much detail as possible: why this pull request is important enough for us to consider, what changes it contains, what you had to do to get it to work, how you tested it, etc. Be detailed but be clear: use bullets, examples if needed, and simple, straightforward language.
* Pull requests should in general include:
 * All necessary code changes but not more than those
 * Documentation (can be through code comments and/or end-user documentation/help for new features)
 * Tests (if pull request is fixing a bug, tests should fail without the pull request and succeed with it; if pull request is adding a new feature, tests should test all aspects of this new feature)

If you are planing to work on something big, please announce that by commenting/opening a related ticket first and describe your plan. We would hate to have to steer you in a different direction after you have already put in a lot of hard work.

## Guidelines for performing code review

You should comment on all things you notice, because maybe the author has not noticed it themselves, they might not be aware of the issue at all, or maybe the remark can lead to a broader discussion how to address a more general issue behind it. 

## Ways to respond to code review feedback

* disagree with the code review comment, optionally propose an alternative/compromise
* agree with it and fix it
* add a comment to the code making clearer why something is done as it is
* add TODO to the code, so that it is known that some shortcoming is known, possibly with some ideas how to address it
* open a ticket for later, if it is something bigger, or something we should have more discussion about

Just because something is being commented on it does not mean that it has to be fixed then and there. You can decide or discuss which of the above options makes the most sense in the current pull request and broader roadmap/timeline context.

### Code Style

For now, we are sticking closely to what's documented in the Meteor guide. Take a look at the following for more info and helpful examples:
* [Code style](https://guide.meteor.com/code-style.html)
* [Application structure](https://guide.meteor.com/structure.html)
* [Testing](https://guide.meteor.com/testing.html)

## Financial contributions

We also welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our [open collective](https://opencollective.com/Grow-IoT).
Anyone can file an expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of the community, it will be "merged" in the ledger of our open collective by the core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be reimbursed.
