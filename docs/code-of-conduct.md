The Common Garden community is made up of a mixture of professionals and volunteers from all over the world and across many different disciplines.

Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to when they are participating within this community and project. These rules apply equally to founders, mentors and those seeking help and guidance.

This is not an exhaustive list of things that you cannot do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it is intended â€“ a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate. Together with this code of conduct see also the [principles which guide us](Principles).

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the Common Garden project. This includes slack, the mailing lists, the issue tracker, our forum, and any other spaces created by the project developers which the community uses for communication.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by contacting a Common Garden team member.

* **Be welcoming, friendly, and patient.**
* **Be considerate.** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we are a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's primary language.
* **Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It is important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the Common Garden community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the Common Garden community.
* **Be careful in the words that you choose.** We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior are not acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
  * Violent threats or language directed against another person.
  * Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
  * Classist, elitist, intellectually orthodox, or otherwise oppressive language.
  * Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
  * Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
  * Personal insults, especially those using racist, sexist, or otherwise oppressive terms.
  * Unwelcome sexual attention.
  * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
  * Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
* **When we disagree, try to understand why.** Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and Common Garden is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we are different. The strength of Common Garden comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint does not mean that they are wrong. Do not forget that it is human to err and blaming each other does not get us anywhere, rather offer to help resolving issues and to help learn from mistakes.
