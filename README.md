# Installing Grow-IoT (OSX and Linux)

You need to install [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) if you haven't already. To do so, open your terminal and enter:
```
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

Then clone the repo, enter the new directory, and start meteor.

```
git clone https://github.com/CommonGarden/Grow-IoT
cd Grow-IoT
meteor
```

And that's it! You should now have a meteor application running on http://localhost:3000
